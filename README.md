# steeringevolution
Steering Evolution, based on "coding challenge 69" by CodingTrain:
https://github.com/CodingTrain/website/tree/master/CodingChallenges/CC_069_steering_evolution/P5

Intention is to extend the original by:
- showing statistical info (number of vehicles, food and poison, healthiest vehicle etc.)
- switch to ES6 classes
- see if debug information can be tweaked by drawing things differently
- etc.
- etc.
